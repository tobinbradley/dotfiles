# dotfiles

Ye olde dot files. Do with them as you will.

Literally every line of code was was pried out of the dot files of smarter people than I, too many people for me to name, or unfortunately, remember. If you see something in here you wrote, thank you.

I'm assuming some things here:

* You have zsh, tmux, and vim installed, with vim 8 or higher for a few plugins
* You're using oh-my-zsh
* For linting, I have nodejs installed with eslint, csslint, and eslint-plugin-vue. Add more stuff as needed.

There's a setup script that clone's the repo, backs up your existing .vimrc/.zshrc/.tmux.conf files, and links the ones in the repo, or just copy and paste as you will.

Enjoy!
